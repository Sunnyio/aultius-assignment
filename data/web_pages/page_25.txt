SIPs
Investments
What will be the NAV for my order?
Applicable NAV is based on realization of fund by respective AMC house and subject to successful order processing by BSE star before cut-offs. Here ‘realization of funds’ means that NAV applicable for your order will depend on if the fund house has receievd money or not
Please find the cut-off timings for various types of funds and orders
Furthermore,
NAV applicability for orders placed on Saturday, Sundays and other market/public holidays depends on when orders are placed on exchange. Here it is
the
next business day.
Payments made via UPI mode generally result in
same-day
NAV if the order is placed before cut-off.
This happens because settlement to ICCL happens generally happens before cut-off if made via UPI.
Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements.
Payments made via Netbanking generally result in next working day’s NAV. This happens as settlement to ICCL does not happen real time and generally takes places on ‘T+1’ basis. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. So even if order and payment is successful before cut-off, If the payment mode is netbanking, This might result in next day’s NAV.
In Summary, In some cases, Even if order and payment happens before cut-off, NAV will depend
on settlement to ICCL and realization of funds by AMC
I am not able to view my SIP order that I placed recently?
Your orders will appear in orders only if you have made the payment today. If you have not selected ‘Make first payment now’. Your SIPs will appear only in SIPS section
To view all your registered SIPs click please go to SIPs section or click on the link below:
Manage SIPs
When will my investment appear in my portfolio?
Your Investments will appear in your ‘investments Tab’ when your orders moves to ‘Completed’ section of your Orders Tab.
This happens
when we get th
e
confirmation of Unit allotment by respective AMCs. This process generally takes 3/4 working days from order placement date.
Your portfolio updation date in Order timeline is our estimate of when Unit allotment confirmation from AMC will come through.
Please do not worry, This date date does not have any relation to your NAV date. Your NAV date depend on realization of funds by AMC.
Why is my instalment order in progress if SIP date is yet to come?
We generally create your SIP installment order 2/3 working days before your due date as we have to co-ordinate with your Auto-pay linked bank account well in advance to ensure your SIP instalments goes through smoothly on due date.
Order Date is when we create your SIP instalment order in our system and SIP due date is when money will be debited from your Autopay linked bank account.
NAV applicable is usually of your SIP due date.
When will SIP amount get debited from my bank account for my Active SIPs?
Your money will get debited automatically only if your SIP is linked to an autopay.
If your SIP is linked to an autopay. SIP amount will get debited on SIP due date.
Will my order get successful?
We have not received confirmation of successful payment from your bank. We will update the status as soon as possible.
Your order will be confirmed when we receive confirmation of payment and confirmation
of
order placement by exchange. If both this stages are completed successfully. Your order will be successful.
Please don’t worry, If we do not get confirmation or if payment fails. Entire amount will be debited to your source bank account in 4-6 working days.
What will happen if I do not have sufficient balance in my bank account on SIP due date?
Your SIP instalment will fail if you do not ensure sufficient balance in your autopay linked bank account.
Your bank can also charge you if you do not ensure sufficient balance in your bank account on SIP due date.
Money got deducted from my bank account but payment status shows payment in progress?
We have not received confirmation of successful payment from your bank account. We will update the status as soon as possible.
Please don’t worry, If we do not get confirmation or if payment fails. Entire amount will be debited to your source bank account in 4-6 working days

My money got debited but transaction shows as failed. When will refund happen?

Will my SIP get created if my order is in Failed state?
No, Your SIP will only be created when we received confirmation of successful payment from your bank account.
If payment fails, Your SIP payment will not be registered.
I got less money than what I placed an withdrawal order for?
Your withdraw amount is converted to corresponding units while placing order at exchange. We calculate the units to be withdrawn based on current NAVs.
Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days)
For example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd.
Consider the following scenario for withdraw order placed on June 3rd:
If NAV on 3rd June > 2nd June, You will receive an amount greater than order amount.
If NAV on 3rd June < 2nd June, You will receive an amount lesser than order amount.
In Summary, you will receive an amount according to latest NAV.
Will my next instalment be auto-debited?
Your next SIP instalment will be Auto-Debited from your bank account if you have a valid Auto-pay setup.
If not please setup an Autopay so that your future SIP instalments can be automated.
To setup an Autopay, Please click below:
{Setup Autopay}
What is Stamp duty?
The government collects 0.005% of the overall purchase amount of any mutual fund scheme as stamp duty.
So even if entire amount is debited from your bank account, 0.005 percent of total amount is deducted and hence when order is completed, Same is reflected as invested amount.
