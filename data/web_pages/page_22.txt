Where can I find my UPI ID?
Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using.
I don’t have a UPI ID. Can I apply for an IPO?
In case you don’t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list.
Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form.
How can I create my UPI ID?
You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app
Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App
Verify your mobile number
Register the passcode (it is required to open the app)
Select your bank from the options available
The app will fetch your bank details
In case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM
Set up a UPI PIN for security
Now you can check your UPI ID in the profile section.
Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle?
For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed.
In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application.
Why can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO?
In case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO.
Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list.
When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order?
Below are a few things you can do:
Go to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not.
In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application
OR
Make sure your Payments App is updated.
OR
If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid.
How to approve an IPO mandate request?
You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app.
By when can I approve the UPI mandate request?
Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO.
What are the charges of applying for an IPO?
With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO.
How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app?
NRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app.
However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank.
What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price?
Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.
This price is ascertained at the allotment stage.
When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.
In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment.
Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply?
You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor.
Can I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account?
It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.
You need to check with your bank for more details.
Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account?
You cannot apply via the Angel One app.
However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank.
My daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account?
The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply.
Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank.
Why didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO?
As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.
Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.
If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.
Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.
If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank .
Can I modify my IPO bid?
Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.
Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.
You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid.
However, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid.
Why is my IPO application rejected?
Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected
You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate
Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN
For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because
Jill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack
Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN
When will my funds be blocked and unblocked?
Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.
Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.
Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date.
How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment?
We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by
Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN
Applying at cut-off price
Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN
For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because
Jill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack
Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN
Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?
Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.
So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.
Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date.
Why didn’t I get my IPO allotment?
Common reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are
Non-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription
Rejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:
1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN
2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN
3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price
Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO?
Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket.
When is the next IPO coming?
Visit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s.
I have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do?
Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time.
It will reflect shortly in your IPO order book.
Can I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid?
For an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing.
Follow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application
Tap on IPO on the Home page
Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel
Tap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order
How can I check my IPO application status?
Follow the below path to check your IPO application status
Tap on IPO on the Home page
Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status
Your IPO application status will be visible from here
Where to check the IPO allotment status?
Follow the below path to check your subscription status
Tap on IPO on the Home page
Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status
Your IPO subscription status will be visible from here
Can I submit multiple applications for an IPO?
Only 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately.
